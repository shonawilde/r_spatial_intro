# Working with Spatial Data in R

This session covers a basic introduction to spatial data and some of the main packages available (predominantly `sf`). 
Also included are a few scripts to illustrate some common applications as well as a more specific example using some mobile data collected with a mobile laboratory. 

For reference, the session will be based around this [document](https://shona-spatial-intro.netlify.app/).
